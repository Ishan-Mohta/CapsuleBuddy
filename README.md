# CapsuleBuddy - because every dose matters
This app is designed to improve medicine tracking by combining AI-driven safety checks with doctor connectivity. It not only reminds users when to take medicines but also provides dosage guidance, highlights side effects, and checks for risks based on conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Users can share their profiles with doctors for remote monitoring, while a scanner allows quick access to medicine details. In emergencies, the app can suggest safe medicines when doctors are not immediately available, making it a reliable and comprehensive healthcare management tool.
